## Introduction
In this technical report, we present our work on learning spatial and temporal representations for robotic manipulation tasks. Our goal is to develop a model that can effectively predict future states of objects and robot hand configurations based on current sensor data and actions, and utilize these predictions for reinforcement learning.
